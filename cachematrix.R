## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse 
## of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. The objective of this assignment is to write a pair of 
## functions that cache the inverse of a matrix. Below are two functions that are used 
## to create a special object that stores a matrix and cache's its inverse.

## Write a short comment describing this function
## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

## The first function, makecacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", which is really a list containing a function to
## - set the value of the matrix
## - get the value of the matrix
## - set the value of the invervse
## - get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## Write a short comment describing this function
## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created with the above function. 
## However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse from 
## the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix and sets the value 
## of the inverse in the cache via the setinverse function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
}
